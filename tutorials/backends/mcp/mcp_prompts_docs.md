## Introduction

**Prompts** represent the third core capability of the Model Context Protocol (MCP), alongside tools and resources. While tools enable actions and resources provide data, prompts serve as **pre-defined interaction templates** that guide users and AI systems toward optimal usage of available capabilities.

Prompts in MCP are fundamentally different from simple text prompts used in AI interactions. They are **structured, reusable templates** that encapsulate best practices, domain expertise, and workflow optimization into standardized interaction patterns.

## Understanding MCP Prompts

### Conceptual Foundation

MCP prompts function as **guided interaction templates** that help users leverage tools and resources most effectively. They represent codified expertise about how to accomplish specific tasks within a given domain or system.

Think of MCP prompts as **interactive recipes** that not only describe what to do, but also structure the interaction to ensure optimal results. They bridge the gap between raw capability exposure (tools and resources) and user intent fulfillment.

### Core Characteristics

**User-Controlled**: Unlike resources (which are application-controlled), prompts are selected and invoked by users when they want to accomplish specific tasks or follow particular workflows.

**Template-Based**: Prompts provide structured templates that can be customized with user-specific parameters while maintaining proven interaction patterns.

**Workflow-Oriented**: Each prompt encapsulates a complete workflow or task sequence, often involving multiple tools and resources in a coordinated manner.

**Domain-Specific**: Prompts capture domain expertise and best practices, making complex workflows accessible to users regardless of their technical expertise level.

**Reusable Patterns**: Once defined, prompts can be reused across different contexts, users, and scenarios while maintaining consistency and effectiveness.

### Purpose and Value

**Complexity Abstraction**: Prompts hide the complexity of multi-step workflows behind simple, user-friendly interfaces.

**Best Practice Codification**: They capture and standardize optimal approaches to common tasks, ensuring consistent quality outcomes.

**User Experience Enhancement**: Prompts make sophisticated capabilities accessible to users who may not understand the underlying technical implementation.

**Workflow Standardization**: They establish consistent patterns for task execution across different users and contexts.

## Prompt Architecture

### Structure Components

**Name**: A unique identifier that clearly indicates the prompt's purpose and domain.

**Description**: Detailed explanation of what the prompt accomplishes, when to use it, and what outcomes to expect.

**Arguments**: Parameterized inputs that allow customization of the prompt template for specific use cases.

**Template Content**: The actual prompt text or structure that will be presented to the AI system, with placeholders for argument substitution.

### Prompt Lifecycle

**Definition Phase**: Prompts are defined by developers who understand optimal interaction patterns for specific domains or tasks.

**Discovery Phase**: Users or AI systems discover available prompts through the MCP protocol's prompt listing capabilities.

**Selection Phase**: Users choose appropriate prompts based on their current goals and the task they want to accomplish.

**Parameterization Phase**: Users provide specific arguments or parameters to customize the prompt for their particular context.

**Execution Phase**: The parameterized prompt is used to guide AI interaction, often triggering tool usage and resource access.

### Simple Prompt Example

```python
@mcp.prompt("analyze_logs")
def create_log_analysis_prompt(service_name: str, time_period: str) -> str:
    return f"""
    Analyze the logs for {service_name} over the {time_period} period.
    Focus on: error patterns, performance issues, and unusual activities.
    Provide actionable recommendations for improvements.
    """
```
